<p class="p2 cap">For two weeks we have been listening to the presentation
of religions. We have heard philosophies of religion
profound and subtile, to some minds fascinating in their
grace and mysticism. It may be wholesome, if not so
agreeable to have our attention now called to the practical
workings of some of these religions and their effect on
the life and destiny of man. Moreover, as missionary
workers, it is wise for us to know not only the present
needs of the people, but the religious forces which long
centuries have wrought into every tissue of their thought,
feeling and action.</p>

<p>Without question religion is the supreme force in history.
Religion creates the ideals and aspirations, and so chisels
the character of mankind. In the order of nature the worshiper
becomes like the being worshiped. “As a man
thinketh in his heart, so is he.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>The world has known many religions, some of them eminent
for the tremendous power with which they have held
millions in their sway over centuries of time; eminent also
for profound philosophy, lofty ideals, and sometimes a high
morality. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave us the test for Himself
and His teaching: “By their fruits ye shall know
them.” The conditions of society, temporal and spiritual,
are the fruits by which any religious system may be known.</p>

<p>In the nature of things the factor that most universally
moulds society is woman. The boy is father of the man,
but the woman is mother of the boy, hence the study of
the teaching of any religion concerning woman, and of her
character and place in society as the result of that religion,
is vital both to the correct understanding of the system
and of what it has wrought for the world.</p>

<p>The most venerable and possibly the most powerful
Ethnic religion is Brahmanism. Rising in India when
that was the land of literature and art, the home of the
cultured Aryans, for fifteen centuries this religion wrought
unhindered on the people. At first a simple nature worship,
it degenerated into a pantheon in which all the
powers of nature were gods. On this was built a sacerdotalism
with caste and idol worship. It became an oppressive
tyranny. At this juncture, 500 years before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Christ, a new and forcible factor entered the life of the
people in the birth of a king’s son, Gautama Buddha,
known in history as the great Reformer of Brahmanism.
I have not time to speak of the fierce theological war that
ensued (400 years), or of the bright <i lang="fr">coup d’etat</i>
 of the Brahmans
in finally accepting Buddha as the ninth incarnation
of Vishnu.</p>

<p>Each of these systems evinces profound thought and lofty
ideals, Buddhism a high morality. Each contains elements
of truth, and each has been a tremendous power in
the history of the race. Striving for supremacy on the same
field, the result was a coalition. Together they enter the
stream of history under the name of Hinduism. The
time has been long enough, the field favorable and broad
enough for the completest results, and the present condition
of society in India affords an opportunity to see the
results.</p>

<p>Sir Monier Williams, the distinguished Sanscrit scholar
of Oxford, says: “Although India in the early periods of
Brahmanism was a land of literature and science, the present
characteristics are poverty, ignorance and superstition.
Whatever profound thoughts lay about the roots of Hinduism,
it held and still holds the 280,000,000 of India in the
bondage of degradation, cruelty and immorality.” “The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
average income per individual is less than that of any other
civilized country, barely $13.50 per year, against $20 even
for the Turks, $165 for every Englishman, and $200 for
every man, woman and child in the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Dr.
John Short, Surgeon General of India, long resident
among the people says: “Wherever the Hindu religion
predominates, there immorality and debauchery run riot.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teachings.</div>

<p>The Code of Manu is the highest religious
authority among the Hindus. You ask a
Hindu about the date and age of his great law-giver and
he quickly replies, “He was son of the self-existent
Brahm.” Manu’s whole teaching about woman is based
on the assumption of her impurity. For instance, a Brahman
is enjoined “to suspend reading the Veda if a woman
comes in sight.” Her ear is not pure enough to hear what
the vilest man may read. “Though unobservant of approved
usage, or enamoured of another woman, or devoid
of good qualities, yet a husband must constantly be revered
as a god by a virtuous wife.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Dharma Sastra, chap. 5, page 154.</p>

</div>

<p>“Let the wife who wishes to perform sacred oblation
wash the feet of her husband and drink the water, for the
husband is to the wife greater than Vishnu.” Again,
“Women have no business with the text of a sacred book,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and having no evidence of law, and no knowledge of expiatory
texts, sinful women must be foul as falsehood itself,
and this is a fixed rule.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And it has remained fixed
for forty-three centuries.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Seclusion.</div>

<p>The modern Brahmans like to claim that
the present custom of immuring their wives
in prison-like rooms had its origin in Mohammedan invasion.
This is certainly not the whole truth, for in the
unalterable law of Manu, written 900 years before Christ,
we read, “A woman is not allowed to go out of the house
without the consent of her husband, she may not laugh
without a veil over her face or look out of a door or a window.”
“It may be that when the Mohammedans came,
some fifteen centuries after these laws had been in force,
they put the crown on the arch already waiting for them.
They may have tightened the chains by which woman was
already enslaved,”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the teachings of Manu are sufficient
to account for all we see in India to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Child Marriage.</div>

<p>The people of the Western World
have long wondered why the Hindus
were so tenacious of their, to us, revolting customs of
child marriage. It is only when we learn that it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
simply a custom but a part of their religion that we apprehend
the reason. The sacred laws of the Hindu declare:
“If a daughter is married at the age of six, the
father is certain to ascend to the highest heaven. If the
daughter is not married before seven, the father will only
reach the second heaven. If a daughter is not married
until the age of ten, the father can only attain the lowest
place assigned the blest. If a girl is not married until she
is eleven years of age, all her progenitors for six generations
will suffer pain and penalties.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> When recently an
effort was made to induce the Government to raise the
legal age of marriage to twelve years, great excitement
prevailed. The Brahmans set apart days of fasting and
prayer. Multitudes came in processions to the temples,
in some cases beating their breasts and calling aloud to the
gods to spare them from such calamity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Women of the Orient, page 135.</p>

</div>

<p>The worst feature of the system of child marriage is seen
among the Kulin Brahmans, the highest of all. Girls in
these families must not marry into a lower caste, and the
supply of Kulins is limited, so fathers who have not money
to induce some young men to marry their daughters, are
compelled to give their little girls to those who make a
living by being husbands. Thus a child of twelve may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
given as the fortieth or fiftieth wife of some old man. Although
it is certain she will soon be a widow, even that is
preferable to allowing her to remain unmarried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infanticide.</div>

<p>“The code of Manu forbids a woman to
read the scripture or offer prayer by herself.
She is to have no individuality. She exists only in
her father or her husband; without a husband she is soulless.”
This doctrine bears its legitimate fruit in the custom
of murdering infant girls. It is easy reasoning, that
it is better to murder a soulless child than not to be able to
betroth her and so bring disgrace on the whole family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Widows.</div>

<p>“The Hindu sacred books reach their
climax of cruelty in the requirements concerning
the widow. She may have only been a betrothed
infant or a child of a few years. It makes no difference.”
The Shasters teach that if the widow burns herself alive on
the funeral pile of her husband, even though he had killed
a Brahman, that most heinous of deeds, she expiates the
crime. For long centuries widows have been a literal burnt
offering for the redemption of husbands. The English
Government has prohibited the suttee, but being considered
by the family as one rejected of the gods, the widow’s
life is such a degradation, such a sorrow, it would seem
merciful to let her die. Manu wrote, “Let not a widow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
ever pronounce the name of another man, for by remarriage
she brings disgrace on herself here below, and shall be
excluded from the seat of her Lord.” To-day in India under
the Hindu religion the widow may not take food more
than once in the day. She must go without food and
water for forty-eight hours twice in the month. At a
meeting of the highest religious court a few years ago it
was gravely decreed that, if acting on medical advice, a
widow did sometimes take a little water on fast day, the
offense might be condoned. O, the burning pathos of the
Hindu widow’s prayer: “O God, let no more women be
born in this land.” India has now 21,000,000 of widows,
nearly 100,000 of them under nine years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nautch Girl.</div>

<p>Hinduism touches its lowest depths in
the degradation of woman in what the enlightened
Hindu, Mr. Mozoomdar, called in the Parliament
of Religions “consecrated prostitution” of the Nautch
or dancing girls in the temples. The subject is too delicate
and too horrible for me to speak of in detail, but as it
is a much honored part of this religion it cannot be omitted.
The Brahmans claim that it is a most sacred service,
having its origin in prehistoric ages in a promise made by
Vishnu himself. In a few words the reason and method
is this: Parents who have a son very ill will vow to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
god that if the son’s life is spared they will consecrate a
little girl to the temple; or the parents believing that honor
or wealth will be the result, consecrate a girl to the god; or
the Brahmans select the most beautiful little girls, the
parents rejoicing in the religious honor.</p>

<p>From the hour of consecration the little thing is treated
with peculiar respect. She alone of the girls of the family
is taught to read. When she becomes ten or twelve years
old, her father, mother and nearest relatives take her to
the great temple. They go with the priest into the inner
shrine. The girl places her hand into the god’s hand, the
priest repeats certain prayers and charms. He then hangs
a string of cowrie shells around the girl’s neck and the poor
little thing repeats after him her marriage vow, which vow
is to prostitute herself to any pilgrim to the shrine who
demands it.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The position of these religious prostitutes
in Hindu society is so highly respectable that no festival
or wedding is celebrated without their presence. They
are asked to tie the wifely ornaments on the neck of the
bride. They being married to a god can never be widowed
and their touch is lucky. In elegant attire with costly
jewels and perfumes, charmingly graceful, they lead their
wretched lives, bring great sums into the treasury of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
temple, and, as they are religiously taught, accumulate a
store of blessing for themselves in a future state. John
Short, M. D., Surgeon General of India, Member of
Anthropological Society, London, says: “The Nautch
girl is recognized and patronized by the Hindu religion.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Prof. T. M. Lindsay, University of Glasgow.</p>

</div>

<p>There was a time in this fair eastern land when women
were in a position of respect similar to that among the ancient
Hebrews. Husband and wife were equal in all domestic,
social and religious life. “The Brahmans have
themselves preserved the record of women engaging in
philosophical discussions, and disconcerting their most
celebrated doctors by the depths of their objections.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Some of the Vedic hymns were composed by women. By
degrees the condition of woman has deteriorated until by
the law of their religion she is “now consigned to a degradation
probably without a parallel in the history of the race.”
It is true, Buddha, in the sixth century before Christ,
taught that men and women were equal, but even his influence
has never been strong enough to reform the Brahmanical
laws about women. The Hindus have a saying:
“Education is good, as milk is good, but milk given to a
snake becomes venom, and education given to a woman
becomes poison.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>A quotation from the personal experience of Prof. T.
M. Lindsay, D. D., so pertinently sums up the Hindu
creed about women that I quote it. “I remember asking
a learned Vedantist, who had spent two days in teaching
me something about his belief—a man who had read
Spinoza, Berkeley and Hegel—whether he could give me
any definite proposition which all the people who were
Hindus could accept. He very readily said, ‘That woman
is a wicked animal. That the cow is a holy animal.’” No
brilliant presentation of Vedic learning, no poetic picture
of Brahman or Buddhist philosophy so recently heard in
the Parliament of Religions, will prevent the world from
arraigning Hinduism for cherishing, in the sacred name of
religion, the grossest vices, and basely degrading woman
and all society. “By their fruits ye shall know them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religions of China.</div>

<p>In the Empire of China, under a government
distinguished for its stability and
justness, among a people spoken of before Christ as “Those
who dwell apart,” and known from the time of Ptolemy
as just, mild, frugal and industrious, comprising one-fourth
the human race; three religions of confessed power, not as
rivals, but as co-ordinate and supplemental, have for many
centuries sought to solve the problem of life, death and
immortality. The time has been long enough, the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
favorable for a perfect experiment. Confucianism,
the oldest of the three, gave what is probably the best code
of morals man ever gave to men. Confucius was himself
an earnest reformer. The late Dr. Legge, professor of
Chinese in the University of Oxford, says: “Confucius
saw the terrible wretchedness of his people and set himself
to find a remedy. Yet to the one principal cause of the
misery of the masses, polygamy and the low social condition
of women, he gave no thought.” In his treatise on human
relations, in that of husband and wife, he regards the
wife as the servant of the husband and enjoins absolute
obedience. During all these forty-three centuries, while
Confucius has done much for good government and has
set some high moral standards for men, women have
reaped no benefit from the teachings of the sage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taoism.</div>

<p>Lao-tsze, the founder of Taoism, a religion
of no little power in China, made no effort to
elevate the people, and his religious system does not recognize
the existence of woman. In the beginning, the work
of Taoism, was to repress the passions.</p>

<p>“<em>Not to act</em> is the source of all power,”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was an ever
present thesis. To-day Taoism is a system of magic and
spiritism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhism.</div>

<p>Much vaunted, “gentle Buddha,” gives
to the women of China one only hope.
Through its doctrine of transmigration of souls, it is possible
that through obedience to her husband and his relatives,
and the birth of a son, she may in some future aeon
have the happiness of being returned to this world a man.
If a man commits a crime he may be returned to earth a
woman. The one fervent prayer of the women as they
crowd the Buddhist temple is, that they may be returned
to earth as men. When the women apply to the priests
for instruction they are told “When you die your soul
will pass into the land of spirits where it may remain ages
before it is allowed to return to earth and inhabit the body
of a man. You will need money to pay toll on the bridges,
and you must fee the ferrymen, especially the lily boat to
cross the lake of blood.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> (This fee is $30.) The priests
claim to have opened communication with the spirit land
and their drafts are honored there. In one part of the
temple these drafts are sold, the priests placing the seal of
the Temple on them. Of the $400,000,000 annually
given for idol worship in China, at least seven-eighths
is given by women and three-fourths of that by women too
poor to obtain enough of even the coarsest food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage.</div>

<p>The customs and principles of marriage
among any people are the exponents of woman’s
place in the social scale. Chinese women are
bought and sold in marriage. The wife is forever subject
to her husband and his parents; only when she becomes
the mother of sons does she receive the respect of the
family. Divorce is practically at the pleasure of the husband,
or he may sell her to another man. Undesired at
birth, liable to be sold while a child for prostitution,
never educated, her low estate naturally leads to the crime
of infanticide. Little wonder that they innocently ask,
“Why save the life of a girl?”</p>

<p>What to-day is the place of this vast Empire among the
nations? The combined forces of these three religions
working for twenty-three centuries upon one-fourth of the
human race has shed no light on the two great foci, the
family into which every human being is born, and that
immortality to which every mortal soul aspires. Nor has

<div class="sidenote">Religions of Japan.</div>

<p>Shintoism the primal cult of the Japanese,
has no system of morals and takes little
or no notice of woman’s existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>About the year 552 of the Christian era, Buddhism entered
the Mikado’s empire, and after a thousand years of
struggle with Shintoism, gained supremacy.</p>

<p>While Japanese women are not so pitiably degraded as
in India or China, we read in their book of “Instruction
for Woman,” “Woman is the creature of man.” “A woman’s
husband is her God.” Concubinage, “divorce if
the wife is not obedient to her husband’s parents” or is unkind
to a concubine, and the selling of young daughters
for prostitution, tell the story.</p>

<p>The Japanese Buddhist Bible teaches that “the sins of
three thousand of the worst men all together do not equal
the sins of one woman.” Even in “Buddhism’s best Gospel”
among the articles given by Buddha himself we find
only this negative hope. “Although a woman may not
be born into My Country, yet the woman who hears the
name of Amida Buddha, and is excited thereby to the
hatred of the condition of woman, and an earnest longing
for the salvation of others, shall not be re-born as a woman.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>For this crumb of comfort Japanese women are devoted
to the worship of Buddha. The timbers of the great
Buddhist temple building in Kyoto said to cost three million<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
dollars, are all hauled to the ground and raised into
the structure by ropes made of hair which devoted women
have cut off and sent for this purpose.</p>

<p>Among the Ainu, the aboriginal inhabitants of the island
of Yesso, the women do not worship the gods, even
separately. “The reason commonly given among them is,
that the men fear the prayers of the women in general,
and of their wives in particular.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mohammedanism.</div>

<p>There are few more pathetic scenes in
history than the casting out of Hagar and
Ishmael from the polygamous home of Abraham. “Abraham
rose up early in the morning and took bread and a
bottle of water” and gave it unto Hagar and her child “and
sent them away.” The picture is realistic; that erect, well
poised figure, with the bottle on her shoulder, that dark
Egyptian face with chiseled lines of sorrow, illuminated
now with righteous anger, as she gives one last haughty
look toward Sarah’s tent and turns toward the wilderness
of Beersheba. Very soon the curtain lifts upon the desert
scene. The water is spent. Hagar places the child under
the scant shade of a shrub and lifting up her voice, weeping
cries out, “Let me not see the death of the child.” At
this crisis a voice is heard from heaven: “Lift up the lad,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
I will make of him a great nation.” And they dwelt in
the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife
out of the land of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>The years go by and centuries are numbered. We find
the fulfilled promise of a “great nation” in a people in
whose veins on the one side is filtering the blood of the
great Abraham, mingling with the larger proportion of the
idolatrous Egyptian, nomadic in habit, with a genius for
conquest, with a language distinguished for softness and
copiousness, with a literature of great antiquity and high
poetical merit, dwelling in the Peninsula of Arabia. Of
these people, in the fifth century of the Christian era,
Mohammed, the founder of Islam, was born. A youth of
great sincerity and purity, his domestic life with his wife,
Khadija, is as beautiful as could be found among a non-Christian
people. But when at the age of fifty-two he sets
himself up as a prophet, and becomes the husband of
eleven wives, we find him guilty of the grossest crimes,
robbery, murder, and butchery which rival the Emperor
Nero.</p>

<p>“Judged by the smallness of the means at his disposal,
and the extent and permanence of his work, his name is
illustrious. By his will he abolished a cherished idolatry
and bowed to himself the hearts of his countrymen, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
gave to the world a creed which has been a tremendous
force on the destinies of the nations. To the impulse he
gave, numberless dynasties owe their existence. Fair
cities, stately palaces and temples have arisen. At a
thousand shrines the voice of the faithful invokes blessings
on him.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> “He saw with a correct spiritual vision the
elemental truth of all religion. There is only one God.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
For twelve centuries the teachings of Mohammed have
borne fruit in human lives. Not only in the land of its
birth, but in many lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Koran.</div>

<p>We turn the pages of the Koran with eager
hope that we may find in the writings of this
man some teaching that shall lead to the uplifting of woman.
The most hopeful word the Koran has for woman
is in the second chapter: “Whoso doeth good works and is
a believer, whether male or female, shall be admitted to
Paradise.” The practical exegesis of a woman’s “good
works” is, obedience to the husband. Without that good
work she can not enter Paradise. Again in the fourth
chapter, entitled “Women,” we read, “Men shall have pre-eminence
above women, because of those advantages
wherein God hath caused the one to excel the other, and
for that which they expend of their <em>substance in maintaining</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
<em>their wives</em>. The honest women are obedient, careful
in the absence of their husbands, for that God preserveth
them by <em>committing them to the care and protection of the
men</em>. But those, whose perverseness ye shall be apprehensive
of, rebuke and remove them into separate apartments
and chastise them.” The degraded and degrading practice
of scourging and beating wives, having the sanction
of the Koran, will be, in the words of Dr. Jessup, “indulged
in so long as Islam as a faith prevails.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polygamy.</div>

<p>Note the polygamous teaching of the
Koran. “Every Moslem is allowed four free
wives and as many concubines as his right hand possess;”
and the faithful are positively promised that in Paradise
they shall have seventy-two houris for wives, besides the
wives they have here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divorce.</div>

<p>According to the Koran, the husband may
divorce a wife without warning or assigning a
reason. The husband has only to say, “Thou art divorced.”
Even life may be taken at the will of the husband.
Woman is practically a chattel. A Mohammedan being
asked, “What is the price you pay for a good wife,” replied;
“About the same as for a mule, twelve or fourteen
pounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Estimate.</div>

<p>A polite Mohammedan would not speak of
his wife without using the same apologetic
formula he would use if he were speaking of a donkey or a
hog. Indeed so degrading is the orthodox Mohammedan’s
idea of womanhood, we cannot mention it here.
The Koran says nothing about a woman’s praying, therefore
she is excluded from the Mosques at the hours of
prayer. Behold a religion that practically excludes one-half
the human race! It was not until Mohammed was
fifty-eight years of age, and the husband of many wives,
and had under his own roof experienced what the Moslem
women of to-day declare, when there is more than one wife
“there is fire in the house,” that he wrote in the Koran
the “ordinance of veil,” that badge of jealous subjugation,
which marks an era in the degradation of women in all the
Orient. The regulation costume shrouds the women from
the head to the ankle in a cotton or silk sheet of black or
white. Around the head is tied a yard long linen or cotton
veil in which before the eyes is a piece of open work
about the size of a finger which is the only look out and
ventilator. No part, not even a hand or an eye, can be
seen.</p>

<p>See the picture; with fearful foot-steps, with no hope in
man, with little knowledge of the “All Father,” no knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of Him who said, “Come unto me all ye that labor
and are heavy laden,” for twelve cycling centuries, an unceasing
ghostly procession has marched from birth to
death.</p>

<p>Theckla, a Christian martyr of the first century, standing
in the arena at Antioch, bemoans in her prayer the
shame of all women in her unclothing. The clothing of
woman in the veil of the false prophet is a shame to all
womanhood. “The whole life of a Mohammedan woman
is mirrored in that pathetic Arabic proverb ‘The threshold
weeps for forty days whenever a girl is born.’” The
spider’s web which once saved the life of Mohammed has,
as by the hand of a Vulcan, been forged into a chain which
in this nineteenth century in the name of religion dares
hold woman, and through her, 200,000,000 of mankind in
a singularly hopeless degradation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persia.</div>

<p>The sacred books of Zoroaster give women a
higher place than any other Ethnic religion.
Women are given the same religious rites as men, yet even
here “woman’s first duty is obedience to her husband, and
disobedience is a crime so heinous as to receive punishment
after death.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Miss Mary C. Collins, who has lived many years among
the North American Indians, says, “The Indian is a religious
man, and it is his religion that makes him cruel.”</p>

<p>The story becomes monotonous. All non-Christian religions
degrade women, and as woman is, so is all society.</p>

<p>To-day the all-sufficient Christian evidence, is the immeasurable
contrast between heathen and Christian society.</p>
